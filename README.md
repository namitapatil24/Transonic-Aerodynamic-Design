**Course**: MSc Aerospace Dynamics, Cranfield University  
**Supervisors**: Dr Simon Prince and Dr Davide Di Pasquale  
**Tools Used**: VGK, VGK_2D, VFP, XFOIL

## üìñ Overview


This project applies advanced low fidelity computational techniques (VGK, VGK_2D, and VFP) to design, optimize, and analyze a transonic wing planform composed of root, crank, and tip airfoils. The study aims to maximize aerodynamic performance, reduce drag, and ensure safe operational margins.

The design of transonic wings for long-haul commercial airliners is critical to balancing aerodynamic efficiency and operational safety. Transonic flow regimes present unique challenges due to the formation of shock waves on the airfoil surfaces, which can lead to **wave drag**, **flow separation**, and **buffet onset**. 

To address these challenges, supercritical airfoils are employed to delay drag divergence and maintain favorable lift-to-drag ratios. These airfoils feature:
- **Flattened upper surfaces** to minimize shock strength.
- **Aft cambering** to enhance rear loading for lift production.
- **Optimized leading-edge radii** to manage flow acceleration and curvature.
