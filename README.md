## üìñ Overview

This project focuses on the **design, optimisation, and analysis** of a **transonic wing** for a long-haul commercial airliner. Using computational tools such as VGK, VGK_2D, and VFP, the study aimed to improve aerodynamic efficiency, reduce wave drag, and ensure safety margins under cruise conditions.

## üèÜ Key Objectives

1. **Airfoil Design**:
   - Create airfoil profiles for the root, crank, and tip sections of the wing.
   - Optimise profiles for minimum drag and sufficient lift at transonic conditions.
2. **Wing Design**:
   - Integrate airfoil sections into a finite wing geometry.
   - Analyse the effect of twist, sweep, and dihedral on performance.
3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Evaluate cruise performance using VGK_2D and VFP solvers.
   - Compare spanwise load distributions with ideal elliptical lift.
